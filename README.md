# PokeApi Test Automation

🔬 This repository contains an automated test suite for testing PokeApi endpoints. The tests are written in JavaScript using Axios for making HTTP requests and Jest as the testing framework.

## Technologies Used

🚀 JavaScript: A versatile language that integrates seamlessly with web APIs and offers great support for asynchronous operations.
🌐 Axios: A powerful HTTP client for making requests in JavaScript. It simplifies the process and handles response parsing.
✨ Jest: A JavaScript testing framework that comes with built-in assertion functions, mocking capabilities, and extensive reporting.

## Test Cases

The test suite covers the following PokeApi endpoints:

1. Retrieve a Pokemon by ID
2. Retrieve a Move by ID
3. List all Pokemon
4. List all Abilities
5. List all Types

Each test case ensures that the API response meets the expected criteria.

## Prerequisites

📋 Node.js (v12 or higher) installed on your machine

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install

4. Run the tests using the following command:

   ```shell
    npm test

   The test suite will be executed, and the results will be displayed in the console.

## Extending the Test Suite

🔍 The test suite can be extended by adding more test cases or modifying existing ones. Each test case is defined as an individual test function in the test file (pokeapi.test.js) for better organization and modularity.

Feel free to explore and enhance the test suite based on your specific requirements or any changes to the PokeApi.

Happy testing! 🎉🔥
